# 🌱 Smart Afforestation & Soil Monitoring System

## 🚀 Project Overview
Deforestation is one of the major global challenges affecting climate change and biodiversity.  
This project presents an *IoT-based Smart Afforestation System* that helps in selecting the right soil and environmental conditions for planting trees, ensuring higher survival rates and sustainable reforestation.

We developed a *working prototype* that collects real-time soil and environmental data using sensors and provides intelligent recommendations for tree plantation.
